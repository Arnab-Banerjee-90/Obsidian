Sometimes you'll want text to stand out from surrounding text a paragraph or heading. For example, give a piece of text emphasis or importance. HTML comes with semantic elements like strong, and small for formatting text. And other elements like span that can be used to markup pieces of text just for styling purposes.

## 1. The `strong` element
---
The first, the `strong` tag, indicates strong importance, seriousness, or urgency for its content, and the text is typically displayed in <u>bold</u> by the browser.

## 2. The `em` element
---
The HTML `em` element marks text that has stress emphasis. The `em` element can be nested, with each level of nesting indicating a greater degree of emphasis.

The text is typically displayed in italics by the browser.

## 3. The `small` element
---
HTML even offers tags like `small`, which you can use to display small text. You use the small tag for marking up disclaimers, caveats, legal restrictions or copyright information.

## 4. The `sub` and `sup` element
---
The `sub` element is used to display text in subscript, and likewise the `sup` element displays text within it as superscript.

## 5. The `abbr` element
---
The **`<abbr>`** HTML element represents an abbreviation or acronym.
When including an abbreviation or acronym, provide a full expansion of the term, using the `title` attribute

```html
<abbr title="Hypertext markup language">HTML</abbr>
```
